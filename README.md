# ML_Solubility_Predictor
This project aims to predict the solubility of chemical compounds using the Delaney Solubility dataset. The dataset contains molecular descriptors that help in building predictive models. Two different machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, were used to analyze and predict solubility.
